# Microblog

## Description
It's a simulation of an online blog where you can see both the client and the server side, a client can perform some actions related to a classic blog (post messages, replies, follow people, etc...) and the server treats all the requests comming from the client.

Everything run on the terminal with custom made commands (enter help to see all of them) so no GUI.


## Usage
First you have to run the MicroblogCentral program in a terminal, otherwise you will not be able to connect with a user
On another terminal, run the Main program
There isn't any authentication system, so when they ask you for a login, just enter the name you want.
